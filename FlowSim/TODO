TODO

OPTIMIZATION
- smart tree structure (collapse long branches without forks into single nodes)
- check p-invariant and sigarcs for PA sim

GENERAL
- compare performance to the results in ivan's paper

DONE
- partition probabilistically identical states in first iteration and simulate
  only once per pair of partitions
- partition networks in iterations after the first and simulate only once per
  pair of identical networks
- use STL sort to sort states and successors
- add #defines to turn optimizations on/off
- recognizing trivial cases (all arcs present, no arcs present, only one node on
  at least one side of the network)
- detect significiant edges
- rewrote large parts of compact maxflow network creation to integrate better with
  StrongCMF (decreases complexity of network creation)
- added debug information about memory usage
- clean up code, add proper comments
- use network partitioning only for partitions with few successors (#define few)
- plot performance with various heuristics turned on/off for comparison
- document various heuristics
- case studies
- renamed StrongCMF to StrongSimulation
- added support for CTMCs
- rewrite relation map as table of bitset vs. table of bools (eightfold reduction in size)
- split up StrongSimulation class into several sub classes to handle different
  model types more cleanly
- added support for PAs
- create benchmark tool
- state partitioning for PA simulation
